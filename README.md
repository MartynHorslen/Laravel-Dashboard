# Laravel Dashboard
> This project is to build an admin dashboard that would allow a hypothetical company to create, read, update and delete (CRUD functionality) records for client companies and employees.
> The Laravel app itself should have: basic authorisation, make use of database seeders and migrations, use laravel storage with public access to logos (need to research exactly what this is called and how to do it again), use the 7 RESTful actions, 
> Live demo [_here_](https://www.example.com). <!-- If you have the project hosted somewhere, include the link here. -->
